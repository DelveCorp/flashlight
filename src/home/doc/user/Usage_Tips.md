# Usage Tips

## General Tips

- **Regular Backups**: Ensure you regularly back up your Delve data to prevent data loss.
- **Monitor Performance**: Use the monitoring tools provided by Delve to keep an eye on system performance and address any issues promptly.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep your Delve installation up to date with the latest releases to benefit from new features and security patches.

## Search Tips

- **Filter Results**: Use the `qs_filter` command to filter your search results based on specific criteria. For example, `qs_filter host="localhost"` will only include events from the localhost.
- **Sort Results**: Use the `qs_order_by` command to sort your search results. For example, `qs_order_by created` will sort the results by the creation date.

## Data Ingestion Tips

- **Batch Processing**: When ingesting large amounts of data, use batch processing to improve performance. Configure the batch size and maximum queue size appropriately.
- **Use Syslog**: For real-time log monitoring, use the syslog-receiver utility to ingest syslog messages from your network devices and servers.

## Customization Tips

- **Custom Search Commands**: Create custom search commands to extend Delve's functionality and tailor it to your specific needs.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Design custom dashboards to visualize your data in a meaningful way. Use charts, tables, and other visualizations to present your data effectively.
- **Custom Alerts**: Set up custom alerts to notify you of important events or issues. Use the `send_email` command or custom processors to send notifications based on specific criteria.

## Security Tips

- **Secure Configuration**: Ensure your Delve configuration is secure. Use strong passwords, enable TLS, and follow best practices for securing your Django application.
- **Access Controls**: Implement proper access controls to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality. Use Django's authentication and authorization system to manage user permissions.
- **Regular Audits**: Perform regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in your Delve installation.
