# Security

Implementing security best practices is crucial for protecting your Delve instance and the data it processes. This section covers key security aspects, including the `SECRET_KEY` setting, configuring TLS, and other relevant security practices.

## SECRET_KEY Setting
The `SECRET_KEY` setting in `settings.py` is a critical component of your Django project's security. It is used for cryptographic signing and should be kept secret. Here are some best practices for managing the `SECRET_KEY`:

- **Keep It Secret**: Never share your `SECRET_KEY` or commit it to version control.
- **Use a Strong Key**: Generate a strong, random key. You can use tools like `./fl gen-secret-key` to generate a new key.
- **Rotate Secret Keys**: The `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` can be set to a list of fallback secret keys for a particular Django installation. These are used to allow rotation of the `SECRET_KEY`.
- **Environment Variables**: Store the `SECRET_KEY` in an environment variable and read it in `settings.py`. For example:
  ```python
  import os

  SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY', 'your-default-secret-key')
  ```

## Configuring TLS
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is essential for securing data in transit between clients and the Delve server. Delve provides several configuration options for enabling and configuring TLS:

- **DELVE_SSL_PRIVATE_KEY**: The path to the TLS private key file (in PEM format).
- **DELVE_SSL_CERTIFICATE**: The path to the TLS certificate file (in PEM format).
- **DELVE_SSL_MODULE**: The SSL module to use with the web server.

To configure TLS, set these options in `settings.py`:

```python
DELVE_SSL_PRIVATE_KEY = '/path/to/private_key.pem'
DELVE_SSL_CERTIFICATE = '/path/to/certificate.pem'
DELVE_SSL_MODULE = 'builtin'
```

## Additional Security Practices
- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure that your Delve instance is accessible only over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
- **Update Regularly**: Keep your Delve instance and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
- **Restrict Access**: Use firewalls and access controls to restrict access to your Delve instance.
- **Monitor Logs**: Regularly monitor application and server logs for suspicious activity.
- **Database Security**: Secure your database by using strong passwords, enabling encryption, and restricting access.
