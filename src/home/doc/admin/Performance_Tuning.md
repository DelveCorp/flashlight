# Performance Tuning

Optimizing the performance of your Flashlight instance is crucial for ensuring it can handle large volumes of data and provide fast response times. This section covers various performance tuning techniques, including PRAGMA options for SQLite, database indexing, caching strategies, and general Django performance tips.

## PRAGMA Options for SQLite
SQLite provides several PRAGMA options that can help improve performance. These options can be set in the `settings.py` file under the `DATABASES` configuration.

### Example Configuration
Here is an example configuration with some common PRAGMA options:

```python
# filepath: /flashlight/settings.py
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'timeout': 120,
            'init_command': 'PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL; PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;',
            'transaction_mode': 'IMMEDIATE',
        },
    }
}
```

### PRAGMA Options Explained
- **journal_mode=WAL**: Enables Write-Ahead Logging, which can improve concurrency and performance.
- **synchronous=NORMAL**: Reduces the level of synchronization, which can improve write performance at the cost of slightly increased risk of data loss in case of a crash.
- **timeout**: Sets the timeout for database connections.
- **transaction_mode=IMMEDIATE**: Starts a write transaction immediately, which can reduce contention.

## Database Indexing
Proper indexing of your database tables can significantly improve query performance. Ensure that frequently queried fields are indexed.

### Example Indexing
Here is an example of how to add indexes to your models:

```python
# filepath: /your_app_name/models.py
from django.db import models

class MyCustomModel(models.Model):
    str_field = models.CharField(max_length=255, db_index=True)
    int_field = models.IntegerField(db_index=True)
    datetime_field = models.DateTimeField(db_index=True)
```

## Caching Strategies
Caching can help reduce the load on your database and improve response times. Django provides several caching backends, including in-memory caching, file-based caching, and more.

### Example Configuration
Here is an example configuration for using in-memory caching:

```python
# filepath: /flashlight/settings.py
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',
        'LOCATION': 'unique-snowflake',
    }
}
```

### Using Cache in Views
You can use the `cache_page` decorator to cache the output of your views:

```python
# filepath: /your_app_name/views.py
from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page
from django.shortcuts import render

@cache_page(60 * 15)  # Cache for 15 minutes
def my_view(request):
    return render(request, 'my_template.html')
```

## Query Optimization
Optimizing your queries can have a significant impact on performance. Here are some tips for query optimization:

- **Select Only Required Fields**: Use the `only` or `defer` methods to select only the fields you need.
- **Use `select_related`**: This method can help reduce the number of queries by fetching related objects in a single query.
- **Avoid N+1 Queries**: Use `select_related` to avoid the N+1 query problem.

### Example Query Optimization
Here is an example of how to optimize queries:

```python
# filepath: /your_app_name/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import MyCustomModel

def my_view(request):
    # Select only required fields
    queryset = MyCustomModel.objects.only('str_field', 'int_field')

    # Use select_related to fetch related objects in a single query
    queryset = queryset.select_related('related_model')

    return render(request, 'my_template.html', {'objects': queryset})
```

## General Django Performance Tips
Here are some general tips for improving the performance of your Django application:

- **Set DEBUG to False**: Ensure that `DEBUG` is set to `False` in production to disable debug mode.
- **Check Your Logging Configuration**: If excessive logging is enabled, it can seriously impact performance. 
- **Use another Production-Ready Web Server**: Flashlight uses CherryPy by default which is production ready, but you can also use another production-ready web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI to serve your Django application which could improve performance.
- **Enable Gzip Compression**: Enable Gzip compression to reduce the size of responses.
- **Optimize Static Files**: Use Django's `collectstatic` command to collect and optimize static files by serving them with you web server instead of having Django serve them with whitenoise (the default).

### Example Configuration
Here is an example configuration for setting `DEBUG` to `False` and enabling Gzip compression:

```python
# filepath: /flashlight/settings.py
DEBUG = False

MIDDLEWARE = [
    // ...existing code...
    'django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware',
]
```

By following these performance tuning techniques, you can optimize your Flashlight instance to handle large volumes of data and provide fast response times.
