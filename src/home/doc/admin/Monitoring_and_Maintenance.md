# Monitoring and Maintenance

Monitoring and maintaining Delve is crucial for ensuring its smooth operation and performance. This section covers various aspects of monitoring and maintenance, including using Django management commands and performing backups.

## Monitoring System Health
Monitoring the health of your Delve instance involves keeping an eye on system resources, application logs, and performance metrics. Here are some key areas to monitor:

- **System Resources**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage to ensure the system has enough resources to handle the workload. Also look for oportunities to streamline certain data flows to improve resource usage.
- **Application Logs**: Regularly check application logs for errors, warnings, and other important messages. Logs can be found in the `log` directory.
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor response times, request rates, and other performance metrics to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize performance. The logging system can be fine-tuned to gain insights into these metrics without allowing the logs to become overly verbose.

## Using Django Management Commands
Django provides several management commands that are useful for monitoring and maintaining your Delve instance. Some key commands include (see the output of `./fl --help` for a complete list):

- **`./fl check`**: Checks the entire Django project for potential problems.

    ```bash
    ./fl check
    ```

- **`./fl showmigrations`**: Lists all migrations and their status.

    ```bash
    ./fl showmigrations
    ```

- **`./fl migrate`**: Applies database migrations.

    ```bash
    ./fl migrate
    ```

- **`./fl test`**: Runs the unittest test suite

    ```bash
    ./fl test
    ```

### Django Extension Commands

The Django Extensions module provides a number of helpful commands. Here are some of the more useful ones in the context of Delve:

- **`./fl shell_plus`**: An enhanced version of the Django shell with autoloading of models and other conveniences.
    ```bash
    ./fl shell_plus
    ```
- **`./fl graph_models`**: Generates a visual representation of your Django models.
    ```bash
    ./fl graph_models -a -o models.png
    ```
- **`./fl show_urls`**: Displays all the URL patterns in your project.
    ```bash
    ./fl show_urls
    ```
- **`./fl sqldiff`**: Compares the database schema with your models and displays differences.
    ```bash
    ./fl sqldiff
    ```

## Performing Backups
Performing regular backups is essential to prevent data loss and ensure data integrity. Django provides the `dumpdata` and `loaddata` management commands to facilitate backups and restores.

### Backing Up Data
Use the `dumpdata` command to export data from the database to a JSON file. This command can be used to back up specific apps or the entire database.

```bash
# Back up the entire database
fl dumpdata > backup.json

# Back up specific apps (e.g., users, auth)
fl dumpdata users auth > backup_users_auth.json
```

### Restoring Data
Use the `loaddata` command to import data from a JSON file into the database. This command can be used to restore data from a backup.

```bash
# Restore data from a backup file
fl loaddata backup.json

# Restore specific apps (e.g., users, auth)
fl loaddata backup_users_auth.json
```

### Custom User Model
Delve includes a custom user model in the `users` app. However, the default Django `Group` and `Permission` models are used for managing user roles and permissions. When performing backups and restores, ensure that data from the `users` app and the `auth` app is included to maintain user accounts and permissions.
