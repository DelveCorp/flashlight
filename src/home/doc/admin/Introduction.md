# Introduction

## Overview of Delve Administration
Delve is a versatile and powerful platform for ingesting, transforming, and searching through structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. It allows for interactive searches, dashboards, alerts, and more. As an administrator, you will manage the system's configuration, user access, data ingestion, and overall system health.

Delve is built on top of Django, Django Rest Framework, and Django Q, providing a robust and scalable foundation for data management and analysis. The platform is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and highly customizable, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from log analysis and monitoring to data exploration and visualization.
