# Getting Started

## Overview
Flashlight is a versatile and powerful platform for ingesting, transforming, and searching through structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. It allows for interactive searches, dashboards, alerts, and more.

## Background
Flashlight is built on top of several robust technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Django Rest Framework**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
- **CherryPy**: A minimalist Python web framework that allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program.
- **Jinja2**: A modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modeled after Djangoâ€™s templates.

## Installation
For installation instructions, please refer to the [Flashlight Administration Manual](../administration/index.md). The User Manual assumes that Flashlight is already installed and configured.

## Logging In
Once Flashlight is installed, you can log in to the web interface using the credentials provided by your administrator.

## User Interface Overview
The Flashlight web interface consists of several key components:

- **Browsable REST API**: Provides access to almost all of the data that Flashlight has.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for using and configuring Flashlight.
- **Explore UI**: A dynamic, universal search interface.
- **Admin UI**: An administrative dashboard for managing users, data sources, and system settings.
